**Version: 0.1X**
**Project: Paw References**

**Description**
A simple custom new-tab website that displays a paw-themed logo and fun statistics icons.

**Features**
1. A single-page web application where users can view a stack of cat images.
2. Users should be able to swipe right to indicate “like” and swipe left to indicate “dislike”.
3. Once the user has gone through all the cats, show a summary of how many cats they liked and display the ones they liked.
4. The cat pictures should be sourced from Cataas (https://cataas.com/).
5. The interface should work smoothly on mobile devices, especially focusing on an intuitive and pleasant mobile viewing experience.
6. Beyond this, how you implement the app — including tech choice, UI/UX design, animations, and any added functionality — is completely up to you.
